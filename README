Software Requirements
=====================

Make sure that the following packages are installed:
  - autoconf
  - automake
  - pkg-config

In addition, the following libraries are required by the GLES testbench:
  - glib-2.0
  - libX11
  - GLESv2
  - EGL

Build Instructions
==================

Run the autogen.sh script from the top of the source tree:

  $ ./autogen.sh

This will automatically run the configure script. After configuration is
done, run `make':

  $ make

Which will generate the `gles-standalone' binary in the `src' directory.

Running Tests
=============

Running the `gles-standalone' binary without parameters or passing the
`--help' option shows a summary of options and available test cases.

`gles-standalone' outputs a summary of the benchmarking results.

For convenience, the `run-tests.sh' script is provided in the top of the
source tree. It will automatically run all tests.
